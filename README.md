# Diffie-Hellman Check
A quick and dirty bit of code to remind myself how diffie-hellman key exchange works, and to demonstrate how two parties (Alice and Bob) can
agree on a shared secret without exchanging any private keys(numbers). Currently using '48112959837082048697' as my prime and generating a pseudo random number 10 digits long.
